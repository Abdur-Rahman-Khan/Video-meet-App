## Video-meet-App

Live Version:: https://safe-cove-96743.herokuapp.com/

Introduction:<br>
A videochat implementation using Peer to Peer technology with Node.js <br>
Motive: <br>
Privacy is the driving force behind this project. It uses secure technologies like WebRTC to directly connect between participants. The website that provides the web app and mediates the communication stores as few data as possible and does not know anything about the contents of established conversations. No accounts are required. No cookies are used.
<br>
As it uses Peer to Peer connection to transmit Data, so it doesn't store user's video/audio.<br>

The aim of this project is to build a fully-functional prototype where a minimum of two participants can connect with each other to have a video conversation.

My solution is a video-calling web application built with WebRTC, Socket.io,PeerJs and Node.js that provides peer-to-peer video and audio communication in a web browser.
